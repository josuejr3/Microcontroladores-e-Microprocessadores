CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (project):
  The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:

    arm-none-eabi-gcc

  is not a full path and was not found in the PATH.  Perhaps the extension is
  missing?

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to
  the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
